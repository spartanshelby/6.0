25:00 total fixed bugs doesnt matter because developer leaves without impact of seriousness.

Bb us not a race its marathon
29:00 show only js in burp history then send it to gau or run jslinkfinder at beginning. then manually read all endpoints.
Because developer store cred in js. Also there is a hidden endpoints with openredirect/ssrf paths like /endpoint?redir=url change that url to $$$$$.

31:00 when u find nothing then hit paraminer guess parameter then use that to xss,openred,ssrf,etc.
