25:00 total fixed bugs doesnt matter because developer leaves without impact of seriousness.

Bb us not a race its marathon
29:00 show only js in burp history then send it to gap or run jslinkfinder at beginning. then manually read all endpoints.
Because developer store cred in js. Also there is a hidden endpoints with openredirect/ssrf paths like /endpoint?redir=url change that url to $$$$$.

31:00 when u find nothing then hit paraminer guess parameter then use that to xss,openred,ssrf,etc.

11:00 Clientside frontend vs serverside backend. 
Common mistakes is Developers only create security controls on front end clientside.
so test every function by actually if we change anything via burp thats actually secured or not. Dont assume that was securely configured. So test each and every functionality. 
Match & replace not a shame

1)Open burp make a single function multiple times see whats around. Move to next repeat the above until all the whole app functionality used. 
2)Read documentation.
3)clientside vs server side above
4)spend more time on target until u dont need the sourcecode. Full App source is on the mind.

Proxy everything walkthrough and look for openredir,ssrf,etc.,

Post xml instead of json
Post json instead of xml

Rest api
Project/id/myproject/id/
Then remove /project/ look response again remove /id/ ..., one by one

Look for anything in the request that only post,put,patch but not get in the history of each endpoint. Then GET that request may be the pii is present in that.

Concentrate on new features(updated/added new)
