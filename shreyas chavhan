I studied 170+ hrs of top hacker interviews to understand what I was doing wrong. Here’s what I learnt and what I’m planning to do about it:

1)I hunt of bugs to achieve impact, they hunt for impact to find bugs:
What I need to do is, I need to start hunting for impact and treat bugs as tools to reach that impact — always keeping that end goal in mind while hunting. This will give me an aim, making the process fun and fulfilling. The only difference here is the mindset. I may stumble upon the same things I used to stumble upon, but I’ll look at them with different perspective — which will make that process more fun What I need to do is, I need to start hunting for impact and treat bugs as tools to reach that impact — always keeping that end goal in mind while hunting. This will give me an aim, making the process fun and fulfilling. The only difference here is the mindset. I may stumble upon the same things I used to stumble upon, but I’ll look at them with different perspective — which will make that process more fun

2)I try to find places, areas, features or endpoints where the developer might have forgot to put restrictions/protections i.e. the restriction/protection is non-existent. They find places where protections exists and they try to bypass those protections.
If you target a well defended area — you’ll either break those defenses or learn how those defenses work. Both of which are helpful & valuable things in the long run. Bypassing a high value defense leads to high value finding that the company cares about. Learning about those defenses and understanding those defenses in-depth develops that spidey sense that’ll shorten the time understanding the next time you’ll come across such feature as well as find bugs. And this will also make the process of hunting more fun, coz figuring things out by googling & researching is a fun process in itself. 

3)I focused way too much on structure and forcing myself for an outcome or input in terms of efforts that I forgot to make the process of hunting fun:
i used to define a daily/weekly goal of putting in X amount of hours. Then a goal of testing Y amount of endpoints per day. Which inherently are not bad — but it lacks that emotional touch (i.e. enjoying the process). While these are good outcomes to aim at, I basically made myself feel bad when I used to not put in that much time, and whenever I spent time, I tried to optimize my efforts in such a way that’ll get me quick output —avoiding the “fun” aspect of doing bug bounties altogether. I choose bug bounties as my career coz I loved understanding things, spending time breaking things, researching complex topics and feeling that “ahhhaaa” moment whenever I used to understand what’s happening behind the scenes
I’ll try to approach bug bounties in a way such that I enjoy every single minute of time spent hunting. Picking up complex features and trying to break the logic down of that feature on paper and then finding a way to create impact will be my focus. I love simplifying and understanding complex things, this is going to be my primary focus area.
