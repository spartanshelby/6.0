5. Where do objects reveal different data when accessed through different workflows?

## Business Logic Flaws
6. How to exploit negative pricing in new payment flows?
7. Where can race conditions be exploited in inventory/balance systems?
8. How to bypass business limits using integer overflow?
9. What workflow steps can be skipped or reordered?
10. How to exploit time-based logic (free trials, expiration)?

## Authentication & Authorization Edge Cases
11. How to bypass MFA using enrollment/repair flows?
12. Where can horizontal privilege escalation occur in new features?
13. How to exploit OAuth state parameter weaknesses?
14. What endpoints miss authorization checks for specific object states?
15. How to chain low-impact issues into account takeover?

## API & Endpoint Security
16. Where does the API expose different data based on content-type?
17. How to find mass assignment in new JSON endpoints?
18. What GraphQL queries expose excessive data?
19. How to exploit batch operations for privilege escalation?
20. Where do webhooks allow SSRF or replay attacks?

## File Processing & Uploads
21. How to achieve RCE through SVG file upload validation?
22. Where can XXE be found in new import/export features?
23. How to bypass cloud storage signed URL security?
24. What file parsing vulnerabilities exist in new document processors?
25. How to exploit PDF generators for SSRF?

## Third-Party Integrations
26. Where do OAuth implementations mishandle redirect_uri?
27. How to exploit webhook signature verification flaws?
28. What SSRF vectors exist in new image processing services?
29. How to bypass payment gateway security in test modes?
30. Where do API key generation algorithms have weaknesses?

## Configuration & Deployment Flaws

34. What debug endpoints are exposed in production?
35. How to find secret keys in client-side bundles?

## Cryptography & Tokens
36. Where are JWT tokens poorly validated?
37. How to predict or brute-force invitation tokens?

## Cloud & Infrastructure
46. Where do new features expose AWS S3 buckets?
47. How to exploit serverless function authorization flaws?
48. What container escape vectors exist in new deployments?
49. How to find database credentials in new logging systems?
50. Where do new CDN configurations expose origin servers?

## Automation & Tooling
51. How to use differential analysis to find new vulnerabilities?
52. What custom Burp extensions help find state-based flaws?
53. How to automate detection of property exposure differences?
54. Where can machine learning identify anomalous endpoint behavior?
55. How to efficiently compare API versions for security gaps?

These questions target the nuanced, complex vulnerabilities that separate advanced hunters from beginners.
